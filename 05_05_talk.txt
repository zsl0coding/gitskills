It's 2014-05-05 and I didn't do anything for my graduate paper.
I felt guilty.

This afternoon I tried to fix up my old computer, I opened its shell and take out the hard dist, ram to clean it, but it dind't go right. It's still over warmed.
When I look at the file stored in that old computer, I find a text sending to me for my graduate day in 2012-12, I was shocked. After reading the text, I burdened much more. I tried to be a good student, hard studying and nice to people,reading a lot, less playing games ... I failed myself.
